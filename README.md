## Project Background
DeskWorks Consulting is a company that specializes in providing expert technology advice to organizations seeking specialized insights to enhance their business strategies.

The company has noticed a drop in its employees' attendance over the last 12 months. To address this issue, the HR department aims to identify the underlying reasons and implement solutions to improve attendance and reduce absenteeism. This project analyzes absenteeism data in order to uncover trends and insights so that incentive programs can be introduced to reward healthy employee lifestyles, improving attendance and reducing absenteeism.

HR requests:
- Provide a list of healthy individuals with low absenteeism for our healthy bonus program - total budget $1,000 USD.
- Calculate a wage increase or annual compensation for non-smokers for an insurance budget of $983,221 for all non-smokers.
- Create a dashboard for HR to understand absenteeism at work based on the approved wireframe.

## Data Structure Overview
The database structure as seen below consists of three tables: absenteeism_at_work, compensation, and reasons.
